Sure, here are three challenges that a basic (junior) JavaScript developer might face in a job interview:

1 - Implement a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.


2 - Create a small web application that uses an API to fetch data and display it on the page. The application should have a search bar that allows the user to search for data based on a keyword.



3 - Given an HTML document with a button and a paragraph element, write JavaScript code to add an event listener to the button that changes the text of the paragraph element when the button is clicked.
